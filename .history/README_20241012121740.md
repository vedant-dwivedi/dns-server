# Building a DNS Server

## Project Overview

In this project, you will develop a DNS server that can:
- Parse and generate DNS packets.
- Respond to DNS queries.
- Handle various DNS record types.

Throughout this project, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of the following concepts:
- The DNS protocol and its importance in networking.
- DNS packet formats and structure.
- The roles of root servers, authoritative servers, and forwarding servers.
- Different types of DNS records, including A, AAAA, CNAME, and more.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js version 21 or higher installed on your local machine. You can download it from [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Git**: Ensure Git is installed for version control. You can download it from [Git Official Website](https://git-scm.com/).

### Clone the Repository

Start by cloning this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository.git
cd repository
```
# Implementation Details

The main entry point for your DNS server implementation is located in app/main.js. Here, you will find code that needs to be uncommented and modified to complete the required functionality for each stage of the project.

# Running the Program  

To run the program, use the following command:

```
./my_program.sh
```

This script will execute the application defined in app/main.js. Make sure to review the code and implement the necessary logic for parsing DNS packets and handling queries.


# Testing and Submission

After implementing the required features, follow these steps to commit your changes and push them to the repository:

1. Commit your changes with a meaningful message:

```
git commit -am "Pass first stage" # Replace with an appropriate message

```

2. Push your changes to the master branch:

```
git push origin master

```


Time to move on to the next stage!


# Stage 2 & beyond

Note: This section is for stages 2 and beyond.

1. Ensure you have `node (21)` installed locally
1. Run `./your_program.sh` to run your program, which is implemented in
   `app/main.js`.
1. Commit your changes and run `git push origin master` to submit your solution
   to CodeCrafters. Test output will be streamed to your terminal.
